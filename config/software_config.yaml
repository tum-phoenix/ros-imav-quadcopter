# This file is intended to contain parameters we set in our code, but want to ba able to change easily.
# E.g. thresholds, filter parameters, etc.
#
# If we want to change it at runtime, we have to use rosparam and dynamic_reconfigure.
# Before adding something here, consider to make it a rosparam instead.

# example:
# search_rotation: 90
